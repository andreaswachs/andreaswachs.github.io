# Introduction :rocket:

I'm a software development student, with a heart and soul that belongs mainly in back-end development. Since starting my studies, I have become increasingly interested in functional programming. I find the discrete mathematics field very interesting â€” although I'm certainly not a naturally gifted mathematics student.

You might find something of interest on this website throughout time, should you be interested in

- Functional programming, or sometimes just programming in general
- DevOps
- Mechanical keyboards

This file is left intentionally empty by default to be backwards compatible with the initial theme setup.

Although the theme has advanced a little bit and it now allows to specify the content on the main page (even if the list of posts/articles is not intended).
This can be:
- with the list of posts/articles (default: `mainSections = ["post"]) or
- without the list of posts/articles (by setting `mainSections = [""]`)

Markdown supported, ie:

```

Remember that you can also specify a section header for the posts below by configuring the `mainSectionsTitle` parameter in the front matter of this file.
