This repository supports my [GitHub page](https://andreaswachs.github.io/)


## Todo

- [ ] Write meaningful error messages when loading the JSON file goes bad.
- [ ] Look into making posts on the webpage with Markdown. See detailed [plan #1](#plan1)


## Plans

### <a name="plan1"></a>Plan #1

I want to implement the following:

- Posts are written in a markdown document, one document per post
- Markdown files are stored in a given folder
- Make a script to use some utility to convert them to `html`files.
- Keep a JSON file on hand to tell the application which posts to show
- The app now reads the JSON file and loads the different `html` files into the webpage
