# Elixir Algorithms and Data Structures

The *Elixir Algorithms and Data Structures* project is a toy project of mine.

Here, I am practicing my Elixir skills by implementing various algorithms and data structures throughout time. This is very much a project created for my own educational purposes as I of July 2021 work as a student worker with software engineering. In my job we use Elixir for the product that the department that I'm employed in.

The source code for the whole project can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/andreaswachs/elixir-algorithms-and-datastructures). Furthermore, I have also published it as a hex package, which can be found [here](https://hexdocs.pm/eads/readme.html).

Here is a list of algorithms and data structures that I have implemented, and some that I'm thinking about implementing sometime in the future (when I find some time in the calendar):

*Done*

- Ternary Search Tree
  - Function `insert`
  - Function `exists?`

*TODO*

- Ternary Search Trees
  - Function that gets all valid keys in tree
  - Function that gets all valid keys in tree with a given prefix
  - Function that calculates the number of valid keys
- Directed Acyclic Weighted Graph
- General graph stuff
  - Data structure to represent graphs and (weighted, directed) edges
  - DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, A*
  - more stuff to be added later
